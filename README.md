# FinalProject
Contains the instructions for the final project in FinalProject-v2.pdf


For my final project I used the Sport Radar API to get data about the football players in the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots. I was originally going to do only the Seattle Seahawks but I wanted more interactions using the API so I also cached data about the New England Patriots. I cached the height, weight, position, and player name from the HTML file. I had to apply for the API by registering for an account. They sent me an API key that I added to the URL. I used BeautifulSoup to open the HTML file. I referenced code from Project 2. 
My API Key=fea6p82a8ym7ccgvw3dcq2gw
Goals:
1.	Find how many players are within each weight range
2.	Calculate the average height for each position
I created a bar graph about the weight ranges for players in the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots.
